	<p> Local Storage does what the name implies, lets web application store data locally within a users browser without using cookies. The limit is 5MB</p>

	<div id="ex1"></div>
	<p>Here's another example. Local storage only stores string keys and values, so you can't actually store an array- you must stringify it first. </p>
	<div id="ex2"></div>
	<p>Too use it as an associative array, just use square brackets.</p>
	<div id="ex3"></div>
	<p>Never store functions in local storage- you have too use eval() which is the evil demon in security and debugging. Never use eval(). </p>
