<!-- onLoad and onTouchBegin are html dom events. Events are usually used with functions, and the functions won't be used until someone starts something. -->

<p>Mouse over this wonderful picture to see it get bigger and then smaller for an example of a html dom event.</p>

<p>onTouchBegin doesn't seem to actually exist. Just ontouchstart. However, onLoad does exist. For example, the alert you had to click okay on when the page loaded is a onLoad event.</p>

<p>There's also plenty of Animation Events. For example, the div belows me uses a animationstart, iteration, and end to a div element too create a animation effect.</p>

<div id="showDIV" onclick="functionStarting()"> Click to begin</div>

<p>For a Transition Event there is only transitionend.</p>

<div id="anotherDIV">Hover here</div>
