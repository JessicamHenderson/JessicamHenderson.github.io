<p>Methods are functions stored within a object. You can call the method on an object by the same name you assigned the function too. The paragraph below is a example of a method.</p>

<div id="ex1"></div>

<p>There are also built-in methods such as uppercasing a string.</p>

<div id="ex3"></div>

<p>Javascript does not have classes. Thus, when an object is inherited, it is inherited from another object or function. Below is an example of inheritance from a function.</p>

<div id="ex4"> </div>

	<script src="ObjMethod.js">
