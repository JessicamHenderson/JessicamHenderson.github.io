<p>Javascript objects are variables containing multiple valvues instead of just one. you can define and create a single object using object literal or new. Or you can define a constructor and create objects of the constructed type. </p>

<button onclick="usingNew()">New Object</button>
<p id="Cand1"></p>

<p>You can also add or remove properties if you so wish! but we'll just add for the next one too keep the script from getting wild. This also uses inheritance to use the this statement. Inheritance is when you use an object refrence. It allows a great deal of code reuse.</p>
<button onclick="addingNew()">add Object</button>
<p id ="add"></p>


<p>Methods are actions that can be preformed on objects, much like a function definition.</p>
<button onclick="testMethod()">uppercase</button>
<p id="methodTest"></p>
